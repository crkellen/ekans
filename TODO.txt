1. Make it so the snake has a list of food dropped and he goes to them until there is no food left.
	 - Make a food class (to store x and y position, and is alive)
	- Max amount of food on board
	- Init the array in init
	- foodX and foodY will likely be removed entirely and reworked with a check to the list
2. Make it so rations can spawn in first row and column.
	- The issue is some sort of infinite loop issue with Math.random
3. Add UI
	- Display Score
	- Display Food Held
	- Display Gamespeed
4. Make snake also have bounds limits
	- currently if player reaches top or bottom, because of how movement works, it breaks.
5. Fix snake collapsing in on itself, make it so it can't do that.
6. Perhaps make it so if snake eats food, he pauses for one tick (allows the player to gain distance)
7. Make player die if he collides with snake
8. Make start screen/instructions
9. Make gameover screen with restart

BUGS:
If snake eats the ration, the player never gets a new ration.
If the player runs over the food it disappears, but the snake still tries to go for it and gets stuck.
If the player is inside the snake and drops food, food disappears and snake gets stuck.
